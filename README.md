# Task Manager

A Task Manager in Terminal wrote with The Rust Programming Language using the crate [TUI-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs) for the Terminal User Interface and
[SeaORM](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm) as my ORM, using Postgresql as my database.

This app will help me to improve my abilities with the language and know more about the terminal GUIs, also I will use this app for my personal use, to handle the projects
I work in easily.

I will try to make test before make some implementation, this means we're gonna do TDD (Test Driven Development), so we can have a better understanding of what the app does,
and what we want to get from a function, also, this allows us to avoid some types of errors that may bother us in the future.

For each task or feature, or bug, or whatever it needs a commit, except typo errors, I will try create an issue, and in the commit description, link the issue describing what
we are making in the commit.
